# CBC-India AGK Case Study Suite - Replit Documentation

## Overview

The CBC-India AGK Case Study Suite is a Streamlit-based web application providing three AI-powered tools for case study management and development:

1.  **Case Study Analyser**: Evaluates case studies against the CBC-India AGK Case Study Review Rubric, providing detailed scoring, recommendations, and assessment history. It processes uploaded documents (PDF/DOCX) using OpenAI's API.
2.  **CaseConnect**: An AI-enabled case discovery tool that recommends AGK repository case studies to faculty based on course outlines and specific criteria (learners, objectives, competencies, duration, sector). It references a CSV database of 62 cases and provides discussion points, key themes, and direct links to the iGOT platform.
3.  **Case Study Generator**: Drafts new case studies from raw source material (transcripts, reports, URLs, notes). It supports Lesson-Drawing, Decision-Forcing, and Caselet case types through an 8-step wizard, including AI source processing, section drafting, compliance review, and optional teaching note generation. Drafts are auto-persisted and exportable in DOCX/PDF/TXT formats.

The application aims to enhance case study quality, facilitate case discovery for educators, and streamline the case study creation process within the CBC-India AGK framework.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The application uses the Streamlit framework with a wide layout. UI components include custom CSS for styling (Poppins font, blue palette #1E3A8A), interactive data visualizations via Plotly, and PDF/DOCX upload capabilities. It follows a single-page application design with session state management for user authentication and data persistence.

### Backend Architecture

The application's core logic is orchestrated by `app.py`. Utility functions for document processing and OpenAI integration are in `utils.py`, while `assessment_criteria.py` defines the rubric and scoring logic. Database operations are handled by `db_models.py`.

The **Assessment Engine** employs a rubric-based evaluation system with four weighted areas, each containing criteria with specific scoring ranges. AI-powered text analysis uses structured prompts sent to the OpenAI API for evaluation, feedback, and score aggregation. The **Document Processing Pipeline** involves extracting text from uploaded PDFs/DOCX files, AI evaluation, score calculation, and PDF report generation.

### Data Storage Solutions

A PostgreSQL database (with SQLite fallback for testing) is used, managed by SQLAlchemy with a declarative base pattern. The schema includes `users` for authentication and `assessment_history` and `generated_cases` for storing assessment results and draft case studies, respectively. Connection management includes pooling, recycling, and timeout handling.

### Authentication and Authorization

User authentication is username/password-based, secured with bcrypt_sha256 hashing. Session state manages user logins, and user registration includes unique username/email constraints.

### AI Integration

The system integrates with the OpenAI API (GPT models) for all AI-powered text analysis. Structured prompt engineering is used for each assessment criterion, with JSON response parsing for scores and feedback.

### Reporting and Visualization

Reports are generated using the FPDF library, embedding visualizations from Plotly (interactive charts) and Matplotlib (static charts). A tiered grading system (Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement) categorizes performance.
